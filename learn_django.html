{% comment %} 

A variable outputs a value from the context, which is a dict-like object mapping keys to values.

Variables are surrounded by {{ and }} like this:

My first name is {{ first_name }}. My last name is {{ last_name }}.
With a context of {'first_name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Doe'}, this template renders to:

My first name is John. My last name is Doe.
